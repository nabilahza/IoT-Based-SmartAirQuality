# System Description
This project designed and deployed IoT-based Smart Air Quality on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) which monitor the air quality in the room environment by measuring the gas value using MQ-135 sensor. The system simulates air ventilation by activating a fan under moderate, unhealthy, and hazardous air quality conditions, while an LED indicator displays green, yellow, or red to represent the air quality level.
